ver 1.1.3

- added png sequence for all weather icons
- added individual id's to <img> tags in for loop 
- added a conditional for weather icon filename extensions, to display the correct day/night icon
   ** need to confirm if it's working properly **
- changed the $currentTempIcon conditional so it doesn't add extra characters
